# About Me

My name is Jonathan, but I go by Jon, Johnny, and sometimes even JD. I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2023 with BSE's in Computer Science and Engineering Physics. Since then, I've been working as a Software Engineer at Capital One based in Chicago, IL. I've worked on two different teams as part of their rotational program where I've had opportunities to work across the tech-stack on the iOS app, AWS lambda functions, Java APIs, and a Next.js website. If you want to learn more about my professional experience you can see my full resume [here](/resume).

Life after college has been a big period of change and learning for me. That's reflected in the fact that I've dropped some hobbys and picked up some new ones since graduating. At the University of Michigan, I was a member of the Olympic Weightlifting team (If you don't know what that is, and want to learn more you can watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3MVuOVTGfg) video). I don't lift as much as I used to, but I still love to stay active, especially if it gives me a reason to get outdoors. Now in my free time you can usually find me running on the lake shore, practicing my photography skills around the city, or trying to learn electric guitar (all things that I've picked up since graduating).

## Where I'm From

My family has moved around a lot. My dad was born in China and my mother was born in England. I was born in 2001 in Quebec, Canada, but I spent the first half of my childhood growing up in Ann Arbor, Michigan. After elementary school, my family moved to Clemson, South Carolina where they still reside today!
